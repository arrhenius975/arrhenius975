Hi there! 👋 I'm Zak

Aspiring Cybersecurity & Embedded Systems Engineer | 
Passionate about Embedded Systems Development, OS Development, Penetration Testing & Network Security

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student with a deep interest in cybersecurity, embedded systems, and operating system development. My journey in tech has led me to work on projects spanning network security, vulnerability research, and the intricacies of embedded systems. I’m currently exploring new ways to leverage my knowledge in creating secure and efficient systems and developing tools for pentesting and threat detection.

Here’s a bit more about what I’m up to:
- 🔍 Cybersecurity: Focused on vulnerability research, exploit development, and network defense. I enjoy building scripts and tools for network scanning and pentesting.
- 🔧 Embedded Systems: Working on a project to repurpose an Android motherboard as a gaming console, diving deep into hardware-software integration.
- 🖥 OS & Kernel Development: Passionate about understanding the underlying architecture of systems and contributing to open-source projects that push OS capabilities. Currently developing DevDroid-ROM, a custom Android ROM designed to create an integrated development environment on Android devices, enabling native coding with a built-in Bash shell, Python interpreter, and GCC toolchain.
- ⚙️ Skills: Proficient in C, C++, Python, Bash scripting, and networking.
- 🎓 Certification: Currently ongoing Full Networking & CCNA prep guidance By David Through Udemy

### Projects: 
-  [📱 Devdroid-ROM](https://github.com/arrhenius975/Devdroid-ROM): A custom AOSP-based ROM offering a secure, integrated development environment for developers.
-  [🔒 Network Port Scanner](link-to-project): A terminal-based tool for scanning network vulnerabilities.
-  [📱 Embedded Android Console](link-to-project): Repurposing a mobile motherboard to function as a gaming console.
