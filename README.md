# Hi there! 👋 I'm Zak

Aspiring Cybersecurity & Embedded Systems Engineer  
Passionate about embedded systems development, OS/kernel development, penetration testing, and network security.

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student focused on vulnerability research, exploit development, and hardware-software integration. I enjoy building tools for network scanning and pentesting, and experimenting with low-level system design.

## About
- Strong interest in cybersecurity, embedded systems, and OS/kernel development.
- Comfortable with low-level programming, reverse engineering, and hardware hacking.
- I like building practical tools and prototypes that bridge software and hardware.

## Skills
- Languages: C, C++, Python, Bash
- Systems: Linux (kernel/devices), AOSP/Android, embedded Linux
- Networking & Security: TCP/IP, Nmap, Wireshark, basic exploit development, pentesting tooling
- Tools: git, GDB, buildroot/AOSP build system, cross-compilation toolchains

## Projects
- DevDroid-ROM — A custom AOSP-based ROM focused on a secure, integrated development environment for Android devices.  
  Repo: https://github.com/arrhenius975/Devdroid-ROM
- SQL-SMITH — SQL query generator web app (prototype).  
  Live/demo: https://sql-smith.vercel.app

(For each project, consider adding a one-line summary, installation/usage, key features, and screenshots in the project README.)

## Current work
- Repurposing an Android motherboard into a handheld gaming console — hardware-software integration, driver support, and performance tuning.
- OS & kernel development experiments — learning kernel internals and building small kernel modules/tools.
- Continued development on DevDroid-ROM and related tooling.

## Certifications & Learning
- Full Networking & CCNA prep guidance by David (Udemy) — ongoing / completed study resources.
