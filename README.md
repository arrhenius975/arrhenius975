# Hi there! 👋 I'm Zak

Low-level Developer | C/C++ | ASM | OS & Device Driver Development | Linux Internals

Aspiring Cybersecurity & Embedded Systems Engineer  
Passionate about embedded systems development, OS/kernel development, penetration testing, and network security.

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student focused on vulnerability research, exploit development, and hardware-software integration. I enjoy building tools for network scanning and pentesting, and experimenting with low-level system design.

## About 
- Love to work in OS \& kernel development, driver development, cybersecurity and embedded systems.
- Comfortable with low-level programming, reverse engineering, and hardware hacking.
- I like building practical tools and prototypes that bridge software and hardware.
- Love cars and mechanical machines.
- I like to learn physics and mathematics.
- Love to design Hardware (electronic systems/ digital design and Computer architecture)

## Skills
- Languages: C, C++, Python, Bash, ASM (x86_64, x86_32, ARM32, ARM64), C#, Go, Javascript, React, Rust, TypeScript, LateX.
- Systems: Linux (kernel/devices), AOSP/Android, embedded Linux
- Networking & Security: TCP/IP, Nmap, Wireshark, basic exploit development, pentesting tooling
- Tools: git, GDB, buildroot/AOSP build system, cross-compilation toolchains

## Projects (Actively updating over time will add more)
- DevDroid-ROM — A custom AOSP-based ROM focused on a secure, integrated development environment for Android devices.  
  Repo: https://github.com/arrhenius975/Devdroid-ROM
- SQL-SMITH — SQL query generator web app (prototype).  
  Live/demo: https://sql-smith.vercel.app
  
## Current work
- Working on MOSFET enhancement and optimization as full time research intern. 
- Repurposing an Android motherboard into a handheld gaming console — hardware-software integration, driver support, and performance tuning.
- OS & kernel development experiments — learning kernel internals, driver development and building small kernel modules/tools.
- Continued development on DevDroid-ROM and related tooling.
- Working on a GBA emulator using minimal dev tools (c++, SDL2).
- Working on Astronomical physics simulations of recently discovered space events (Binary star lifecycle, Black Widow planet formation, etc) using SDL2, OpenGL, C++.

## Certifications & Learning
- Full Networking & CCNA prep guidance by David (Udemy) — completed.
